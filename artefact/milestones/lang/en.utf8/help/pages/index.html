<h3>Milestones</h3>
<p>Milestones are simple ToDo lists. They are particularly well-suited to milestone medium and long-term endeavours. A milestone can consist of a number of individual activities with which completion dates are associated.</p>
<p>You could use the functionality to:</p>
<uL>
<li>set yourself individual goals for a large fact.</li>
<li>manage your personal learning activities and keep an eye on how many you have already accomplished during the time frame that you have set yourself.</li>
<li>keep track of workshops you have attended for your professional development over time.</li>
</ul>
